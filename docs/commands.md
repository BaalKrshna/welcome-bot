# Commands - Discord Welcome bot

> Prefix: `!w`

If You're not sure what prefix is used can you just `@-mention` the bot (`@welcome-bot#0914`) and it will tell you what prefix is used.

These are the commands currently available:
1. `ping` - Ping the bot.
2. `test` - Test by sending welcome message
3. `set-chan` - Set welcome channel
4. `get-chan` - Get current welcome channel
5. `set-msg` - Set welcome message
6. `get-msg` - Get current welcome message

All these commands should be prefixed with the `prefix` (`!w`) i.e. for command `ping` you have to send `!w ping` in the channel the bot has perms to read and send messages.
