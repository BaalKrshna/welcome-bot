## Self hosting

**We ask you to please not host your own instance of InfusionBot.**  
Even though our license allows it, self-hosted instances of the bot have brought us a lot of headache in the past.  
If you're considering self-hosting, please [try the official instance of the bot first][botinvite].
If you have any concerns about the security of our instance, please contact us.  
We'd love to talk and answer any questions you have.

> If you're really really really going to self-host the bot, please [read our license][license] first, and be aware that we don't provide any self-hosting support which is up to date. You'll be on your own.
> We have archived our [old self-hosting docs](https://welcome-bot.github.io/docs/self-hosting.html), they are available on our website.
